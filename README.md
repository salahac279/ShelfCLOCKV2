# ShelfCLOCKV2
This a SHELF CLOCK arduino program inspired from DIY MACHINES Giant Hidden Shelf Edge Clock project, I added abillity to change color and set time using an HC05 bleutooth module, and some little tricks, once you have uploded it on your arduino you can use the arduino bleutooth app which is already in the play store, to set time just send with the first two digits representing minutes and the second two digits representing hours (EX send 1430 for 14:30) , numbers 1-13 are color related, also mind that it only support 12 hours format, in order for it to display 24H format some changes are required
